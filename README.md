# OmnetppVeinsSUMO_pub

Install [SUMO](https://github.com/DayuanTan/SUMO_dy_public), OmNet++ and Veins respectively.(Or [Instan Veins](https://veins.car2x.org/documentation/instant-veins/))

`SUMO is easy to install. You can follow the official github page. OmNet++ is not install-friendly. I used v5.5.1 and tried on Window, Mac, Ubuntu, even docker but I encountered different kinds of errors. Finally I installed it on Ubuntu 16.04, and it works well later, which is the ONLY platform I suggest for OmNet++ v5.5.1. Instan Veins is also recommended if you only want Veins. But I didn't use it.`

Then leant some basic knowledge about [SUMO (learn here)](https://github.com/DayuanTan/SUMO_dy_public) and [OmNet++ (learn here)](./omnetpp/omnetpp.md) before you start Veins. 

## [Install Veins](InstallVeins.md):

I don't think the official install instruction is good, readable. It's kind of confusing. I suggest to do it following the [instructions](InstallVeins.md).


## Run Veins:

` ./sumo-launchd.py -vv -c sumo` (Refer to [complete steps.](InstallVeins.md))

## Understand Veins's example program
