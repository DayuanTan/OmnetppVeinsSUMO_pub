# OmnetppVeinsSUMO_pub

Install [SUMO](https://github.com/DayuanTan/SUMO_dy_public), OmNet++ and Veins respectively.

```
SUMO is easy to install. You can follow the official github page. OmNet++ is not install-friendly. I used v5.5.1 and tried on Window, Mac, Ubuntu, even docker but I encountered different kinds of errors. Finally I installed it on Ubuntu 16.04, which is the only platform I suggest for OmNet++ v5.5.1. [Instan Veins](https://veins.car2x.org/documentation/instant-veins/) is also recommended if you only want Veins. But I didn't use it.
```

Then leant some basic knowledge about [SUMO (learn here)](https://github.com/DayuanTan/SUMO_dy_public) and [OmNet++ (learn here)](https://docs.omnetpp.org/tutorials/tictoc/) before you start Veins.
